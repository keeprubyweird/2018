  <p>The Conference venue is the historically weird Alamo Ritz Drafthouse, located in the heart of downtown. Each theater seat has its own table. During the conference you'll enjoy some weird talks as you're served gourmet food from the comfort of your oversized seat. All in front of one of the largest screens we've ever seen.<p>
